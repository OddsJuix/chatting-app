# 🗯️ chat thing

welcome to the worst best idea ever. this is a chat app. it works. probably.

## ❗ disclaimer

use this wisely. if people start swearing, being gross, or just generally ruining the vibes too much, i *will* take the entire project down faster than your wifi disconnects.

## 💸 pricing for chaos

you can make chatrooms. you wanna be that cool person who owns a chatroom? awesome.

but:

**it costs $4 per month per chatroom**  
because servers cost money, and i like burritos

## 🧠 dev brain time

**how long this took:** 4 days  
**chance this blows up on google play:** 6/10  
with chatrooms and some secret sauce coming later, it might go boom. or flop. who knows. but hey, we’re trying.

## 🚀 future nonsense

- chatrooms (done-ish)
- chatrooms that don’t explode (soon)
- actual moderation tools
- maybe emojis. maybe not. chaos.

## 🛑 terms of service

yeah yeah i know, reading is hard. but seriously. this part is **not funny**. it’s important.

by using this app, you agree to:

- only one account per human. no clones.
- no swearing. no nsfw. no hate. no creepy stuff.
- don’t dox yourself or anyone else.
- don’t upload things you don’t have the rights to.
- don’t spam. don’t flood chats like a toddler with a hose.
- we’ll moderate when needed. no arguments.
- this might break sometimes. that’s life.
- if we update these terms, you agree to them if you keep using the app.
- we’re not liable if you drop your phone or lose your dignity.
- if you mess stuff up, you might get banned. no refunds. no hugs.

for the full legal wall of text, it's in the app and you gotta scroll to the bottom before you can even press “i accept.” no scroll, no soul.

**thank you for using this absolute mess of an app.**
